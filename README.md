# Getting Started with Create Vite

This project was bootstrapped with [Create Vite with react template](https://vitejs.dev/guide/).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.



### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy.html#testing-the-app-locally) for more information.
### `yarn preview`

This command will boot up local static web server that serves the files from `dist` at `http://localhost:4173`. 
It's an easy way to check if the production build looks OK in your local environment.

See the section about [deployment](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy.html#testing-the-app-locally) for more information.
